                            City of Naples</span></a>, (Italian: Città metropolitana di Napoli) is an Italian
                    Metropolitan
                    City in Campania region, established on January 1, 2015. Its capital city is Naples; within the city
                    there are 92 comune (municipalities).[2][3] It was first created by the reform of local authorities
                    (Law 142/1990) and established by the Law 56/2014, thus replacing the Province of Naples in 2015.

                    The Metropolitan City of Naples is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and by
                    the Metropolitan Council (Consiglio metropolitano). Since 1 January 2015 its head is Luigi de
                    Magistris, as mayor of the capital city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is 96th out of 110 Italian provinces and metropolitan cities by landmass, with an area
                    (1,171 km2 including islands) that is smaller than the core comune of Rome (1,287 km2).[4] Naples is
                    however, Italy's third largest metropolitan city by population, making it one of the most densely
                    populated areas in Europe; the metropolitan region also includes the municipality of Casavatore, the
                    highest-density municipality in Italy (at 12,000 inhabitants/km2). While it contains more than half
                    of Campania's population, it only occupies 8.6% of Campania's landmass (13,590 km2), creating a
                    strong demographic and territorial imbalance with the other four provinces in Campania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Municipalities (comune) in the Metropolitan City vary in size, ranging from 1.62 km2 (Casavatore) to
                    117.27 km2 (Naples); 60% of the municipalities are small (less than or equal to 10 km2), 36% of
                    medium-sized (> 10 km2 and ≤ 25 km2), the rest (11%) more than 25 km2 and, of this, only two
                    municipalities (Acerra and Giugliano) are between 50 and 100 km2 and only the municipality of Naples
                    exceeds 100 km2.

                    Because of its proximity to Vesuvius and Phlegraean Fields, the city is vulnerable to seismic and
                    volcanic activity.

                <p>
                    Metropolitan Cities give large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, a system
                    designed to improve local administration, create efficiency in spending, and better coordinate basic
                    services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection.[5] The Mayor
                    of Naples thus also has powers as Metropolitan Mayor, presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed
                    by 24 mayors of municipalities (comune) within the Metropolitan City.

                    The first Metropolitan Council of the City was elected on 28 September 2014.

                    The history of Naples is long and varied, dating to Greek settlements established in the Naples area
                    in the 2nd millennium BC.[1] During the end of the Greek Dark Ages a larger mainland colony –
                    initially known as Parthenope – developed around the 9-8th century BC,[2] and was refounded as
                    Neapolis in the 6th century BC:[3] it held an important role in Magna Graecia. The Greek culture of
                    Naples was important to later Roman society. When the city became part of the Roman Republic in the
                    central province of the Empire, it was a major cultural center.[4] Virgil is an example of the
                    political and cultural freedom of Naples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For centuries, Naples was the capital of the kingdom of Naples. The city has seen the rise and fall
                    of several civilizations and cultures, each of which has left traces in its art and architecture,
                    and during the Renaissance[5] and the Enlightenment was a major center of culture.[6] During the
                    Neapolitan War, the city rebelled against the Bourbon monarchs, spurring the early push towards
                    Italian unification.
