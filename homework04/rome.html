                            Rome Capital</span></a>,
                    (Italian: Città metropolitana di Roma Capitale) is an area of
                    local government at the level of metropolitan city in the Lazio region of the Republic of Italy. It
                    comprises the territory of the city of Rome and 121 other municipalities (comuni) in the hinterland
                    of the city. With more than 4.3 million inhabitants, it is the largest metropolitan city in Italy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was established on 1 January 2015 by the terms of Law 142/1990 (Reform of local authorities) and
                    by Law 56/2014. It superseded the Province of Rome. The Metropolitan City of Rome Capital is headed
                    by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and governed by the Metropolitan Council
                    (Consiglio metropolitano). Virginia Raggi has been the incumbent mayor since 20 June 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metropolitan cities were given administrative powers equivalent to those of a province. This was
                    done to improve the performance of local administration and to cut local spending by better
                    coordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social
                    programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Rome is also
                    designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor, presiding over a Metropolitan Council
                    formed by 24 mayors of municipalities within the Metro.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Metropolitan City of Rome Capital covers almost one-third of the territory of Lazio. It occupies
                    the flat area of the Roman and the Tiber Valley to the mountains and dell'Aniene Lucretili Sabini
                    and, in addition to the mountainous regions of the Tolfa and Monti Sabatini to the north-west, the
                    area of the mountains Tiburtini Prenestini Simbruini and east, the area of the Colli Albani and the
                    northern foothills of the mountains, and high Lepine Sacco valley to the south-east. The western
                    boundary of the province is represented by the Tyrrhenian Sea on which spread to about 130
                    kilometres (81 mi) from the coast near Rome from Civitavecchia to Torre Astura. In the territory
                    there are several lakes, almost all of volcanic origin, which are concentrated in the north-west of
                    the mountains and Sabatini in the south-east of the Colli Albani.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Metropolitan City of Rome Capital is the centre of a radial network of roads that roughly follow
                    the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the Capitoline Hill and connected Rome with its
                    empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the Capitol, by the
                    ring-road (the Grande Raccordo Anulare or GRA).

                    Due to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for
                    central Italy. Rome's main railway station, Termini, is one of the largest railway stations in
                    Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every
                    day. The second-largest station in the city, Roma Tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed
                    rail terminus.

                Rome is served by three airports. The intercontinental Leonardo da Vinci International Airport is
                Italy's chief airport, is located within the nearby Fiumicino, south-west of Rome. The older Rome
                Ciampino Airport is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as "Ciampino
                Airport", as it is located beside Ciampino, south-east of Rome. A third airport, the Roma-Urbe
                Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which
                handles most helicopter and private flights.
