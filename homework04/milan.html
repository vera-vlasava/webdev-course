                            of Milan</span></a>,
                    (Italian: città metropolitana di Milano; Milanese: cittaa
                    metropolitana de Milan [tʃiˈtɑː metrupuliˈtana de miˈlãː]) is a metropolitan city in the Lombardy
                    region, Italy. It's the second most populous Metropolitan City in the nation after the Metropolitan
                    City of Rome. Its capital is the city of Milan. It replaced the Province of Milan and includes the
                    city of Milan and other 133 municipalities or communes (comuni). It was first created by the reform
                    of local authorities (Law 142/1990) and then established by the Law 56/2014. It has been operative
                    since 1 January 2015.

                    The Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (Sindaco metropolitano) and by
                    the Metropolitan Council (Consiglio metropolitano). Since June 2016 Giuseppe Sala, as mayor of the
                    capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are
                    conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by
                    better coordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and
                    social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Milan is
                    designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor, presiding over a Metropolitan Council
                    formed by 24 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality.

                    Milan metropolitan area is one of southern Europe's key transport nodes and one of Italy's most
                    important railway hubs. Its five major railway stations, among which the Milan Central station, are
                    among Italy's busiest.

                    The Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (ATM) operates within the metropolitan area, managing a public
                    transport network consisting of an underground rapid transit network and tram, trolley-bus and bus
                    lines. Overall the network covers nearly 1,400 km (870 mi) reaching 86 municipalities. Besides
                    public transport, ATM manages the interchange parking lots and other transportation services
                    including bike sharing and car sharing systems.

                    Milan Metro is the rapid transit system serving the city, with 4 lines and a total length of more
                    than 90 km (56 mi). The recently opened M5 line is undergoing further expansion and the construction
                    of the M4 line has been approved. The Milan suburban railway service comprises 10 lines and connects
                    the metropolitan area with the city centre through the Milan Passerby underground railway. Commonly
                    referred to as "Il Passante", it has a train running every 6 minutes (and in the city functions as a
                    subway line with full transferability to the Milan Metro).

                    licensed by the City council of Milan. The city is also a key node for the national road network,
                    being served by all the major highways of Northern Italy.

                    The Milan metropolitan area is served by three international airports. Malpensa International
                    Airport, the second busiest in Italy (about 19 million passengers in 2010), is 45 km (28 mi) from
                    central Milan and connected to the city by the Malpensa Express railway service.Linate Airport,
                    which lies within the city limits and served over 9 million passengers in 2010, and Orio al Serio
