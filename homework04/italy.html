                    officially the Italian Republic (Italian:
                    Repubblica Italiana [reˈpubːlika itaˈljaːna]), is a country consisting of a peninsula
                    delimited by the Alps and several islands surrounding it. Italy is located in Southern Europe,
                    and is also considered part of Western Europe. A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its
                    capital, the country covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with
                    France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino.
                    Italy has a territorial enclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian waters
                    (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous member state of
                    the
                    European Union.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy
                    has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures. In addition to the various ancient
                    peoples
                    dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European
                    Italic
                    peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians and
                    Carthaginians
                    founded colonies mostly in insular Italy, Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna
                    Graecia of Southern Italy, while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy
                    respectively.
                    An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually
                    became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman Republic initially
                    conquered
                    and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering parts
                    of
                    Europe, North Africa and Asia. By the first century BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant
                    power
                    in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and religious centre,
                    inaugurating
                    the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art,
                    and
                    literature developed. Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire,
                    whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture, governments, Christianity
                    and
                    the Latin script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and barbarian
                    invasions, but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics, mainly in the
                    northern and central regions of Italy, rose to great prosperity through trade, commerce and banking,
                    laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. These mostly independent statelets served as
                    Europe's
                    main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of democracy than the
                    larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of central Italy
                    was
                    under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until
                    the
                    19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese
                    and
                    other foreign conquests of the region. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of
                    Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration and art. Italian culture
                    flourished, producing famous scholars, artists and polymaths. During the Middle Ages, Italian
                    explorers
                    discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age of
                    Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening
                    of
                    trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean. Centuries of foreign meddling and conquest and the
                    rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and
                    16th
                    centuries, left Italy politically fragmented, and it was further conquered and divided among
                    multiple
                    foreign European powers over the centuries.

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        The history of Italy is characterized by two periods of unity—the Roman Empire (27 BCE–476 CE) and the modern
        democratic republic formed after the end of World War II. Between those two periods may have been a millennium
        and a half of division and disruption, but that disruption saw one of the world's great flowering of art, the
        Renaissance (circa 1400–1600 CE).

        Italy, sitting in southwestern Europe, is comprised largely of a boot-shaped peninsula that extends out into the
        Mediterranean, as well as a region on the core landmass of the continent. It is bordered by Switzerland and
        Austria to the north, Slovenia and the Adriatic Sea to the east, France and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, and
        the Ionian Sea and the Mediterranean to the south. Italy also includes the islands of Sicily and Sardinia.
    </p>
    <h3 id="roman">Roman Empire</h3>
    <p>
        Between the sixth to third centuries BCE, the Italian city of Rome conquered Peninsular Italy; over the next few
        centuries, this empire spread to dominate the Mediterranean and Western Europe. The Roman Empire would go on to
        define much of Europe's history, leaving a mark on culture and society that outlasted the military and political
        machinations of its leadership.

        After the Italian part of the Roman Empire declined and “fell” in the fifth century (an event no one at the time
        realized was so significant), Italy was the target of several invasions. The previously united region broke
        apart into several smaller bodies, including the Papal States, governed by the Catholic Pope.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ren">Renaissance and the Kingdom of Italy</h3>
    <p>
        By the eighth and ninth centuries, a number of powerful and trading-oriented city-states emerged, including
        Florence, Venice, and Genoa; these were the forces that incubated the Renaissance. Italy and its smaller states
        also went through stages of foreign domination. These smaller states were the fertile grounds of the
        Renaissance, which changed Europe massively once more and owed a lot to the competing states trying to outspend
        each other on glorious art and architecture.

        Unification and independence movements throughout Italy developed ever stronger voices in the 19th century after
        Napoleon created the short-lived Kingdom of Italy. A war between Austria and France in 1859 allowed several
        small states to merge with Piedmont; a tipping point had been reached and the Kingdom of Italy was formed in
        1861, growing by 1870—when the Papal States joined—to cover almost all of what we now call Italy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mus">Mussolini and Modern Italy</h3>
    <p>
        The Kingdom of Italy was subverted when Mussolini took power as a fascist dictator, and although he was
        initially skeptical of German dictator Adolf Hitler, Mussolini took Italy into World War II rather than risk
        losing out on what he perceived as a land grab. That choice caused his downfall. Modern Italy is now a
        democratic republic and has been since the modern constitution came into effect in 1948. This followed a
        referendum in 1946, which voted to abolish the previous monarchy by 12.7 million to 10.7 million votes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
    <p>
        Italy is located in Southern Europe (it is also considered a part of western Europe) between latitudes 35°
        and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia
        and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south,
        it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia
        (the two biggest islands of the Mediterranean), in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San
        Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy, while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave
        in Switzerland.

        The country's total area is 301,230 square kilometres (116,306 sq mi), of which 294,020 km2 (113,522 sq mi) is
        land and 7,210 km2 (2,784 sq mi) is water. Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of 7,600
        kilometres (4,722 miles) on the Adriatic, Ionian, Tyrrhenian seas (740 km (460 mi)), and borders shared with
        France (488 km (303 mi)), Austria (430 km (267 mi)), Slovenia (232 km (144 mi)) and Switzerland (740 km (460
        mi)). San Marino (39 km (24 mi)) and Vatican City (3.2 km (2.0 mi)), both enclaves, account for the
        remainder.
    </p>
    <h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
    <p>
        Italy has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a
        constitutional referendum. The President of Italy (Presidente della Repubblica), currently Sergio Mattarella
        since 2015, is Italy's head of state. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the
        Parliament of Italy and some regional voters in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution,
        resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces
        that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the Civil War.
    </p>
    <h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
    <p>
        At the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants. The resulting population density, at 202
        inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However,
        the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that
        accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast
        regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very
        sparsely populated.

    <h3 id="languages">Languagies</h3>
    <p>
        Italy's official language is Italian, as stated by the framework law no. 482/1999 and Trentino Alto-Adige's
        special Statute, which is adopted with a constitutional law. Around the world there are an estimated 64
        million native Italian speakers and another 21 million who use it as a second language.
        Italian is often natively spoken in a regional variety, not to be confused with Italy's regional and minority
        languages; however, the establishment of a national education system led to a decrease in variation in
        the languages spoken across the country during the 20th century. Standardisation was further expanded in the
        1950s and 1960s due to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television (the state broadcaster RAI
        helped set a standard Italian).
    </p>
    <p>
        The ethno-linguistic minorities officially recognised by Italy
        Twelve "historical minority languages" (minoranze linguistiche storiche) are formally recognised: Albanian,
        Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Provençal, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and
        Sardinian. Four of these also enjoy a co-official status in their respective region: French in the Aosta
        Valley; German in South Tyrol, and Ladin as well in some parts of the same province and in parts of the
        neighbouring Trentino; and Slovene in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine. A number of other
        Ethnologue, ISO and UNESCO languages are not recognised by Italian law. Like France, Italy has signed the
        European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but has not ratified it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a
        regional language. According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, Romanian is the most common mother
        tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of
        the foreign residents aged 6 and over). Other prevalent mother tongues are Arabic (spoken by over 475,000
        people; 13.1% of foreign residents), Albanian (380,000 people) and Spanish (255,000 people).
    </p>

    <h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
    <p>
        In 2017, the proportion of Italians who identified themselves as Roman Catholic Christians was 74.4%. Since
        1985, Roman Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion. Italy has the fifth world's largest
        Roman Catholic population, and the largest Catholic nation in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the central government of the Roman Catholic Church.
        It is recognised by other subjects of international law as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, who is also
        the Bishop of Rome, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained.Often incorrectly referred to
        as "the Vatican", the Holy See is not the same entity as the Vatican City State,which
        came into existence only in 1929.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2011, minority Christian faiths in Italy included an estimated 1.5 million Orthodox Christians, or 2.5% of
        the population; 500,000 Pentecostals and Evangelicals (of whom 400,000 are members of the Assemblies of
        God), 251,192 Jehovah's Witnesses, 30,000 Waldensians, 25,000 Seventh-day Adventists, 26,925
        Latter-day Saints, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 Lutherans, 4,000 Methodists
        (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in
        Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ. Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other
        countries, notably Spain. However, about 20% of Italian Jews were killed during the Holocaust. This,
        together with the emigration which preceded and followed World War II, has left only around 28,400 Jews in
        Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soaring immigration in the last two decades has been accompanied by an increase in non-Christian faiths. There
        are more than 800,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent with some 70,000 Sikhs with 22
        gurdwaras across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Italian state, as a measure to protect religious freedom, devolves shares of income tax to recognised
        religious communities, under a regime known as Eight per thousand. Donations are allowed to Christian, Jewish,
        Buddhist and Hindu communities; however, Islam remains excluded, since no Muslim communities have yet signed a
        concordat with the Italian state. Taxpayers who do not wish to fund a religion contribute their share to
        the state welfare system.
