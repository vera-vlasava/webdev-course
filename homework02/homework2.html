    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <strong> Saint Petersburg</strong> is one of my favourite cities in the world. In my early twenties after I
        graduated from
        the university in Minsk, Belarus, I decided to move to Saint-Petersburg for 1 year just to experience its beauty
        and a very unique spirit of this place. Unfortunately, I could not stand the local weather so I moved back to
        Belarus and then emigrated to Germany, but I’m still in love with this amazing and mysterious city. Further,
        I’ll try to give you my impressions of the best spots in this gorgeous place. <em>But before... a bit of
            history!</em>
    </p>
    <h2>History of Saint Petersburg</h2>
    <p>
        <b>1727</b> - The first bridge across Neva river was built. Neva divided city into many parts and for many years
        different areas of the city were connected just by boats. So bridge-building has became the most important thing
        to do around the Peeter.<br>

        <b>1803</b> - The first Russian round-world sea expedition was started in the city.<br>

        <b>1837</b> - The first railway in Russia has begun operating. The route was St.-Petersburg - Tsarskoe Selo
        (residential of the emperors). For the next decades the rate of "railway length growth" in Russia was the
        largest in a world.<br>

        <b>1863</b> - City sewer system was opened.<br>

        <b>1873</b> - First try to use electricity to light the streets.<br>

        <b>1882</b> - Phone station was opened.<br>

        <b>1895</b> - First car in the city.<br>

        <b>1905</b> - The first Russian revolution happened in St. Petersburg. It was an unorganized riot, which was
        suppressed
        very quickly. But from then on the spirit of imminent change could be sensed in the society. People understood
        it was really the "first" try, the second would follow soon.<br>

        <b>1914</b> - The city was renamed into the Petrograd, because of the war with Prussia. To call something ending
        with
        "burg" was too German for the Russian capital.<br>

        <b>1917</b> - The October Revolution, the monarchy has been overthrown. Almost no destruction in the city.<br>

        <b>1918</b> - The capital was moved to Moscow. The communists wanted to start life afresh, they can't do it in
        the city of Emperors and nobles, so they moved the capital to not so aristocratic Moscow. A little bit later
        they renamed
        St.-Petersburg into "Leningrad", after Lenin, and started renaming other main cities as well (Ekaterniburg,
        Nigny-Novgorod) to get them rid of the Tsarist legacy.<br>

        <b>1940</b> - The first underground metro was opened in Leningrad. It was hard to build, because the city was
        close to
        the sea and there was too much water in the ground. Besides, there was a plan to use it as a bomb shelter in
        case of war, so in the end Leningrad metro ended up to be some of the deepest ones in the world. Even now you'd
        get surprised when you have to go down for 10 minutes in order to take a train.<br>

        <b>1941</b> - Leningrad was blocked by the Nazi army. Hitler wanted to capture the city destroy it fast. It was
        also a
        good strategic spot to continue the attack on Moscow. But the plans were ruined, although the city was
        completely blocked and memories of the blockade are still some of the most haunting in the Russian history.<br>

        <b>1944</b> - Blockade was raised. Thousands of people died of starvation during these years.<br>

        <b>1989</b> - The historical center of the city was added to the UNESCO list of world culture heritage.<br>

        <b>2000</b> - The World Hockey Championship took part in St. Petersburg. It was supposed to be our triumph, but
        became our shame, Russian team for the first time in its history became the 11th.<br>

        <b>2001</b> - Mr Putin, originally from St. Petersburg, became the Russian president and together with him came
        many
        politicians who used to work in the city. People talk about the arrival of "Piterskie" who are taking over from
        the Moscovitans and install a sort of new order in the country's political life.<br>

        <b>2003</b> - Thanks to the 300 year anniversary, the facades on the main streets were renovated, everything was
        made to look good, but a few meters off the main streets you can still find the old, shabby St. Petersburg
        that's
        falling apart, but that also keeps its unique charm that way.

    <h2>My favourite spots in Saint Petersburg <i>(worth to see, believe me!)</i></h2>
    <p>
        Here is the list of my favourite places in the city that you must visit when in town (nothing new but still):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Hermitage (The Winter Palace)</li>
        <li>Rivers and canals of St. Petersburg by boat</li>
        <li>Opening bridges</li>
        <li>The Peter & Paul Fortress</li>
        <li>St. Isaac's Cathedral & Colonnade</li>
        <li>Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I would like to tell about some of them a bit more...
    </p>
    <h3>The Hermitage (The Winter Palace)</h3>
    <img src="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/images/top-20-attractions/hermitage-museum-in-st-petersburg.jpg"
        alt="The Hermitage" width="600" height="300">
    <p>
        Undoubtedly St. Petersburg's most famous visitor attraction, and universally acknowledged as one of the world's
        greatest treasuries of art and antiquities, the Hermitage is a name to be conjured with, and reason enough on
        its own for many travelers to book a trip to St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <h3>The Peter & Paul Fortress</h3>
    <img src="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/images/top-20-attractions/the-peter-and-paul-fortress-in-st-petersburg.jpg"
        alt="The Peter & Paul Fortress" width="600" height="300">
    <p>
        The place where the city of St. Petersburg began, the Peter and Paul Fortress never actually saw military
        action, but has fulfilled a variety of functions over its three-century history, from burial place for nearly
        all of the Romanov Emperors and Empresses to notorious political prison to the site of key experiments in the
        development of Soviet rocket technology. All of these aspects of the fortresses history are celebrated in
        diverse exhibitions across various buildings, and it is the ramshackle charms of these various museums and
        collections as much as the grandeur of the spectacular Ss. Petersburg and Paul Cathedral that make the fortress
        an essential visitor attraction.
    </p>
    <h3>St. Isaac's Cathedral & Colonnade</h3>
    <img src="https://cdni.rbth.com/rbthmedia/images/all/2017/01/16/01_rian_02876184_b.jpg"
        alt="St. Isaac's Cathedral & Colonnade" width="600" height="300">
    <p>
        The low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg's historic centre is dominated by the grand gold dome of St. Isaac's
        Cathedral, the life's work of French architect Auguste de Montferrand and the city's largest and most
        spectacular religious building.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        If you are still thinking about whether to go to St. Petersburg or not just throw away all your doubts and go! I
        promise you will never regret that!
