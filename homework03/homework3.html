                Petersburg</strong></a> formerly known as Petrograd (1914–1924) and later Leningrad (1924–1991), is the
        second-largest city in Russia. The city is situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the
        Baltic Sea, with a population of roughly 5.4 million residents.[8] It is the fourth-most populous city in
        Europe, the most populous city on the Baltic Sea, as well as the world's northernmost city with over 1 million
        residents. As an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea, it is governed as a federal city.

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        <b>1727</b> - The first bridge across Neva river was built. Neva divided city into many parts and for
        many years
        different areas of the city were connected just by boats. So bridge-building has became the most
        important thing
        to do around the Peeter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1803</b> - The first Russian round-world sea expedition was started in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1837</b> - The first railway in Russia has begun operating. The route was St.-Petersburg - Tsarskoe
        Selo
        (residential of the emperors). For the next decades the rate of "railway length growth" in Russia was
        the
        largest in a world.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1863</b> - City sewer system was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1873</b> - First try to use electricity to light the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1882</b> - Phone station was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1895</b> - First car in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1905</b> - The first Russian revolution happened in St. Petersburg. It was an unorganized riot, which
        was
        suppressed
        very quickly. But from then on the spirit of imminent change could be sensed in the society. People
        understood
        it was really the "first" try, the second would follow soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1914</b> - The city was renamed into the Petrograd, because of the war with Prussia. To call
        something ending
        with
        "burg" was too German for the Russian capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1917</b> - The October Revolution, the monarchy has been overthrown. Almost no destruction in the
        city.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1918</b> - The capital was moved to Moscow. The communists wanted to start life afresh, they can't do
        it in
        the city of Emperors and nobles, so they moved the capital to not so aristocratic Moscow. A little bit
        later
        they renamed
        St.-Petersburg into "Leningrad", after Lenin, and started renaming other main cities as well
        (Ekaterniburg,
        Nigny-Novgorod) to get them rid of the Tsarist legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1940</b> - The first underground metro was opened in Leningrad. It was hard to build, because the
        city was
        close to
        the sea and there was too much water in the ground. Besides, there was a plan to use it as a bomb
        shelter in
        case of war, so in the end Leningrad metro ended up to be some of the deepest ones in the world. Even
        now you'd
        get surprised when you have to go down for 10 minutes in order to take a train.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1941</b> - Leningrad was blocked by the Nazi army. Hitler wanted to capture the city destroy it fast.
        It was
        also a
        good strategic spot to continue the attack on Moscow. But the plans were ruined, although the city was
        completely blocked and memories of the blockade are still some of the most haunting in the Russian
        history.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1944</b> - Blockade was raised. Thousands of people died of starvation during these years.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1989</b> - The historical center of the city was added to the UNESCO list of world culture heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2000</b> - The World Hockey Championship took part in St. Petersburg. It was supposed to be our
        triumph, but
        became our shame, Russian team for the first time in its history became the 11th.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2001</b> - Mr Putin, originally from St. Petersburg, became the Russian president and together with
        him came
        many
        politicians who used to work in the city. People talk about the arrival of "Piterskie" who are taking
        over from
        the Moscovitans and install a sort of new order in the country's political life.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2003</b> - Thanks to the 300 year anniversary, the facades on the main streets were renovated,
        everything was
        made to look good, but a few meters off the main streets you can still find the old, shabby St.
        Petersburg
        that's
        falling apart, but that also keeps its unique charm that way.

    <p>
        The first and fairly rich chapter of the history of the local toponymy is the story of the
        city's name. The name
        day of Peter I falls on 29 June, when the Russian Orthodox Church observes the memory of
        Saint Apostles Peter
        and Paul. The consecration of the small wooden church in their names (its construction began
        at the same time as
        the citadel) made them the heavenly patrons of the Peter and Paul Fortress, while St. Peter
        at the same time
        became the eponym of the whole city. In June 1703 Peter the Great gave the site the name
        Sankt Pieter Burkh (an
        emulation of Dutch topographical suffix -burg, which refers to fortified towns and places,
        as Peter was a
        Neerlandophile) which was subsequently russified.[52][53]

    <h2 id="places">Places to Visit</h2>
    <p>
        Here is the list of my favourite places in the city that you must visit when in town
        (nothing new but
        still):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Hermitage (The Winter Palace)</li>
        <li>Rivers and canals of St. Petersburg by boat</li>
        <li>Opening bridges</li>
        <li>The Peter & Paul Fortress</li>
        <li>St. Isaac's Cathedral & Colonnade</li>
        <li>Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I would like to tell about some of them a bit more...
    </p>

    <h3>The Hermitage (The Winter Palace)</h3>
    <img src="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/images/top-20-attractions/hermitage-museum-in-st-petersburg.jpg"
        alt="The Hermitage" width="600" height="400">
    <p>
        Undoubtedly St. Petersburg's most famous visitor attraction, and universally acknowledged as
        one of the
        world's
        greatest treasuries of art and antiquities, the Hermitage is a name to be conjured with, and
        reason
        enough on
        its own for many travelers to book a trip to St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <h3>The Peter & Paul Fortress</h3>
    <img src="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/images/top-20-attractions/the-peter-and-paul-fortress-in-st-petersburg.jpg"
        alt="The Peter & Paul Fortress" width="600" height="400">
    <p>
        The place where the city of St. Petersburg began, the Peter and Paul Fortress never actually
        saw
        military
        action, but has fulfilled a variety of functions over its three-century history, from burial
        place for
        nearly
        all of the Romanov Emperors and Empresses to notorious political prison to the site of key
        experiments
        in the
        development of Soviet rocket technology. All of these aspects of the fortresses history are
        celebrated
        in
        diverse exhibitions across various buildings, and it is the ramshackle charms of these
        various museums
        and
        collections as much as the grandeur of the spectacular Ss. Petersburg and Paul Cathedral
        that make the
        fortress
        an essential visitor attraction.
    </p>
    <h3>St. Isaac's Cathedral & Colonnade</h3>
    <img src="https://cdni.rbth.com/rbthmedia/images/all/2017/01/16/01_rian_02876184_b.jpg"
        alt="St. Isaac's Cathedral & Colonnade" width="600" height="400">
    <p>
        The low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg's historic centre is dominated by the grand gold dome
        of St.
        Isaac's
        Cathedral, the life's work of French architect Auguste de Montferrand and the city's largest
        and most
        spectacular religious building.

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        If you are still thinking about whether to go to St. Petersburg or not just throw away all your doubts and go! I
        promise you will never regret that!
